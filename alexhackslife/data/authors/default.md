I'm Ben's youngest child of four. Though I was coming of age in the Noughties, much of my pop-culture influence comes from the influences of my older siblings. So I'm big into 90s stuff like Sega Genesis, grunge music, and Spielberg Movies, but I also feel like I reach back further than most people my age to the 80s and 70s too.

I have all of my adult teeth now and find joy in watching too much TV & cinema, writing code, playing games and being a weirdo with my wife and two sons.
